# Introduction
Smart Room is an intelligent solution that uses advanced technology to monitor temperature, air quality and fire potential in real time to improve the safety and comfort of occupants under various conditions.
1. The temperature is high, it doesn't detect a fire and the air quality is still good so only the fan is on.
2. Low temperature, no fire detection and poor air quality means the fan will turn on and the window will open.
3. High temperature, detecting fire, and poor air quality then only the window is open and the buzzer is on.

# Tools
The microcontroller used is the ESP8266 which is integrated with WiFi which functions to control and process various components.
1. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT22)
